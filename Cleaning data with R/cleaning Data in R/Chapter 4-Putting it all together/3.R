# After understanding the structure of the data and looking at some brief summaries, it often helps to preview the actual data. The functions head() and tail() allow you to view the top and bottom rows of the data, respectively. Recall you'll be shown 6 rows by default, but you can alter this behavior with a second argument to the function.
