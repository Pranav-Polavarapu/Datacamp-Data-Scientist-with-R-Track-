# Write your own function (2)
#   There are situations in which your function does not require an input. Let's say you want to write a function that gives us the random outcome of throwing a fair die:
# 
# throw_die <- function() {
#   number <- sample(1:6, size = 1)
#   number
# }
# 
# throw_die()
# Up to you to code a function that doesn't take any arguments!

# Define a function, hello(). It prints out "Hi there!" and returns TRUE. It has no arguments.
# Call the function hello(), without specifying arguments of course.
# Define the function hello()
hello <- function() {
  print("Hi there!")
  TRUE
}

# Call the function hello()
hello()
