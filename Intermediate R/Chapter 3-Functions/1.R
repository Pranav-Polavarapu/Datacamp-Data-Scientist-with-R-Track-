# Function documentation
# Before even thinking of using an R function, you should clarify which arguments it expects. All the relevant details such as a description, usage, and arguments can be found in the documentation. To consult the documentation on the sample() function, for example, you can use one of following R commands:
#   
#   help(sample)
# ?sample
# If you execute these commands in the console of the DataCamp interface, you'll be redirected to www.rdocumentation.org.
# 
# A quick hack to see the arguments of the sample() function is the args() function. Try it out in the console:
# 
# args(sample)
# In the next exercises, you'll be learning how to use the mean() function with increasing complexity. The first thing you'll have to do is get acquainted with the mean() function.
