# Equality
# The most basic form of comparison is equality. Let's briefly recap its syntax. The following statements all evaluate to TRUE (feel free to try them out in the console).
# 
# 3 == (2 + 1)
# "intermediate" != "r"
# TRUE != FALSE
# "Rchitect" != "rchitect"
# Notice from the last expression that R is case sensitive: "R" is not equal to "r". Keep this in mind when solving the exercises in this chapter!

# In the editor on the right, write R code to see if TRUE equals FALSE.
# Likewise, check if -6 * 14 is not equal to 17 - 101.
# Next up: comparison of character strings. Ask R whether the strings "useR" and "user" are equal.
# Finally, find out what happens if you compare logicals to numerics: are TRUE and 1 equal?

# Comparison of logicals
TRUE == FALSE

# Comparison of numerics
-6 * 14 != 17-101
# Comparison of character strings
"useR" == "user"

# Compare a logical with a numeric
TRUE == 1
