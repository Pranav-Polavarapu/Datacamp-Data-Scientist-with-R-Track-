# Quick, have a look at your data set
# Wow, that is a lot of cars!

#   Working with large data sets is not uncommon in data analysis. When you work with (extremely) large data sets and data frames, your first task as a data analyst is to develop a clear understanding of its structure and main elements. Therefore, it is often useful to show only a small part of the entire data set.
# 
# So how to do this in R? Well, the function head() enables you to show the first observations of a data frame. Similarly, the function tail() prints out the last observations in your data set.
# 
# Both head() and tail() print a top line called the 'header', which contains the names of the different variables in your data set.
#

# Call head() on the mtcars data set to have a look at the header and the first observations.

# Call head() on mtcars
