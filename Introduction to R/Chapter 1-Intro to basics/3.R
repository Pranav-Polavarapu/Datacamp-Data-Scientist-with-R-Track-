# Variable assignment
# A basic concept in (statistical) programming is called a variable.
# 
# A variable allows you to store a value (e.g. 4) or an object (e.g. a function description) in R. You can then later use this variable's name to easily access the value or the object that is stored within this variable.
# 
# You can assign a value 4 to a variable my_var with the command
# 
# my_var <- 4
