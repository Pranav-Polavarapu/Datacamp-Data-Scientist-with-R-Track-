# How it works
# In the editor on the right you should type R code to solve the exercises. When you hit the 'Submit Answer' button, every line of code is interpreted and executed by R and you get a message whether or not your code was correct. The output of your R code is shown in the console in the lower right corner.
# 
# R makes use of the # sign to add comments, so that you and others can understand what the R code is about. Just like Twitter! Comments are not run as R code, so they will not influence your result. For example, Calculate 3 + 4 in the editor on the right is a comment.
# 
# You can also execute R commands straight in the console. This is a good way to experiment with R code, as your submission is not checked for correctness.

#Instruction
# In the editor on the right there is already some sample code. Can you see which lines are actual R code and which are comments?
#   Add a line of code that calculates the sum of 6 and 12, and hit the 'Submit Answer' button.

# Calculate 3 + 4
3 + 4

# Calculate 6 + 12
6 + 12
