# Variable assignment (2)
# Suppose you have a fruit basket with five apples. As a data analyst in training, you want to store the number of apples in a variable with the name my_apples.
# 
# Instructions
# 100 XP
# Type the following code in the editor: my_apples <- 5. This will assign the value 5 to my_apples.
# Type: my_apples below the second comment. This will print out the value of my_apples.
# Click 'Submit Answer', and look at the console: you see that the number 5 is printed. So R now links the variable my_apples to the value 5.

# Assign the value 5 to the variable my_apples
my_apples <- 5

# Print out the value of the variable my_apples
my_apples
