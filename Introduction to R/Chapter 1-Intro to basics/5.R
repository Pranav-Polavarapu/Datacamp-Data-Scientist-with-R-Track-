# Variable assignment (3)
# Every tasty fruit basket needs oranges, so you decide to add six oranges. As a data analyst, your reflex is to immediately create the variable my_oranges and assign the value 6 to it. Next, you want to calculate how many pieces of fruit you have in total. Since you have given meaningful names to these values, you can now code this in a clear way:
#   
#   my_apples + my_oranges

# Instructions

# Assign to my_oranges the value 6.
# Add the variables my_apples and my_oranges and have R simply print the result.
# Assign the result of adding my_apples and my_oranges to a new variable my_fruit.

# Assign a value to the variables my_apples and my_oranges
my_apples <- 5
my_oranges <- 6

# Add these two variables together
my_fruit = my_apples + my_oranges

# Create the variable my_fruit
my_fruit
