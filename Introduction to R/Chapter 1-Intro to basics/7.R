# Basic data types in R
# R works with numerous data types. Some of the most basic types to get started are:
#   
#   Decimal values like 4.5 are called numerics.
# Natural numbers like 4 are called integers. Integers are also numerics.
# Boolean values (TRUE or FALSE) are called logical.
# Text (or string) values are called characters.
# Note how the quotation marks on the right indicate that "some text" is a character.

# Change the value of the:
#   
#   my_numeric variable to 42.
# my_character variable to "universe". Note that the quotation marks indicate that "universe" is a character.
# my_logical variable to FALSE.
# Note that R is case sensitive!

# Change my_numeric to be 42
my_numeric <- 42

# Change my_character to be "universe"
my_character <- "universe"

# Change my_logical to be FALSE
my_logical <- FALSE
