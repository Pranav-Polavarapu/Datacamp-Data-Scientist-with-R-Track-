# Loading the gapminder and dplyr packages
# Before you can work with the gapminder dataset, you'll need to load two R packages that contain the tools for working with it, then display the gapminder dataset so that you can see what it contains.
# 
# To your right, you'll see two windows inside which you can enter code: The script.R window, and the R Console. All of your code to solve each exercise must go inside script.R.
# 
# If you hit Submit Answer, your R script is executed and the output is shown in the R Console. DataCamp checks whether your submission is correct and gives you feedback. You can hit Submit Answer as often as you want. If you're stuck, you can ask for a hint or a solution.
# 
# You can use the R Console interactively by simply typing R code and hitting Enter. When you work in the console directly, your code will not be checked for correctness so it is a great way to experiment and explore.

# Use the library() function to load the dplyr package, just like we've loaded the gapminder package for you.
# Type gapminder, on its own line, to look at the gapminder dataset.

# Load the gapminder package
library(gapminder)

# Load the dplyr package
library(dplyr)

# Look at the gapminder dataset
