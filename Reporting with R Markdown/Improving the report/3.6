<!--Exercise
Excluding messages
In the past, you haven't encountered messages in the report because the include option has been set to FALSE in the data chunk to prevent the code or the results from the code from appearing in the report. In this exercise, you'll use the message option to prevent messages from appearing in the report, while still including the code in the report.

## Datasets 
### Investment Annual Summary
The `investment_annual_summary` dataset provides a summary of the dollars in millions provided to each region for each fiscal year, from 2012 to 2018.
```{r investment-annual-summary, out.width = '85%', fig.cap = 'Figure 1.1 The Investment Annual Summary for each region for 2012 to 2018.'}
ggplot(investment_annual_summary, aes(x = fiscal_year, y = dollars_in_millions, color = region)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Investment Annual Summary",
    x = "Fiscal Year",
    y = "Dollars in Millions"
  )
```

### Investment Projects in Brazil
The `investment_services_projects` dataset provides information about each investment project from 2012 to 2018. Information listed includes the project name, company name, sector, project status, and investment amounts.

```{r brazil-investment-projects, out.width = '95%', fig.cap = 'Figure 1.2 The Investment Services Projects in Brazil from 2012 to 2018.'}
brazil_investment_projects <- investment_services_projects %>%
  filter(country == "Brazil") 

ggplot(brazil_investment_projects, aes(x = date_disclosed, y = total_investment, color = status)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Investment Services Projects in Brazil",
    x = "Date Disclosed",
    y = "Total IFC Investment in Dollars in Millions"
  )
```

### Investment Projects in Brazil in 2018
The `investment_services_projects` dataset was filtered below to focus on information about each investment project from the 2018 fiscal year, and is referred to as `brazil_investment_projects_2018`. 

```{r brazil-investment-projects-2018, out.width = '95%', fig.cap = 'Figure 1.3 The Investment Services Projects in Brazil in 2018.'}
brazil_investment_projects_2018 <- investment_services_projects %>%
  filter(country == "Brazil",
         date_disclosed >= "2017-07-01",
         date_disclosed <= "2018-06-30") 

ggplot(brazil_investment_projects_2018, aes(x = date_disclosed, y = total_investment, color = status)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Investment Services Projects in Brazil in 2018",
    x = "Date Disclosed",
    y = "Total IFC Investment in Dollars in Millions"
  )
