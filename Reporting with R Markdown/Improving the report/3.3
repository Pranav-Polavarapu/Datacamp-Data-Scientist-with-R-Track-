Adding a table
Previously, you printed the datasets used in your report to your report so that the audience was able to look through the data themselves. Now, you'll create a table of the investment_region_summary to display this information more clearly to your audience. The investment_region_summary provides the total of all investments for each region from the 2012 to 2018 fiscal years.

Load the knitr package in the data code chunk, after the ggplot2 package on line 15.
Create a table of the investment_region_summary data in the tables code chunk that starts on line 44, with column names Region and Dollars in Millions and center alignment for both columns.
Add the following caption to the table: "Table 1.1 The total investment summary for each region for the 2012 to 2018 fiscal years."-->

## Datasets 
### Investment Annual Summary
The `investment_annual_summary` dataset provides a summary of the dollars in millions provided to each of the following regions for each fiscal year, from 2012 to 2018:

1. East Asia and the Pacific      
2. Europe and Central Asia        
3. Latin America and the Caribbean
4. Middle East and North Africa   
5. South Asia                     
6. Sub-Saharan Africa

```{r investment-annual-summary, out.width = '85%', fig.cap = 'Figure 1.1 The Investment Annual Summary for each region for 2012 to 2018.'}
ggplot(investment_annual_summary, aes(x = fiscal_year, y = dollars_in_millions, color = region)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Investment Annual Summary",
    x = "Fiscal Year",
    y = "Dollars in Millions"
  )
```

```{r tables}
kable(investment_region_summary, col.names = c("Region", "Dollars in Millions"), align = "cc", caption = "Table 1.1 The total investment summary for each region for the 2012 to 2018 fiscal years.")
```

### Investment Projects in Brazil
The `investment_services_projects` dataset provides information about each investment project from 2012 to 2018. Information listed includes the project name, company name, sector, project status, and investment amounts.

```{r brazil-investment-projects, out.width = '95%', fig.cap = 'Figure 1.2 The Investment Services Projects in Brazil from 2012 to 2018.'}
brazil_investment_projects <- investment_services_projects %>%
  filter(country == "Brazil") 

ggplot(brazil_investment_projects, aes(x = date_disclosed, y = total_investment, color = status)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Investment Services Projects in Brazil",
    x = "Date Disclosed",
    y = "Total IFC Investment in Dollars in Millions"
  )
```

### Investment Projects in Brazil in 2018
The `investment_services_projects` dataset was filtered below to focus on information about each investment project from the 2018 fiscal year, and is referred to as `brazil_investment_projects_2018`. 

```{r brazil-investment-projects-2018, out.width = '95%', fig.cap = 'Figure 1.3 The Investment Services Projects in Brazil in 2018.'}
brazil_investment_projects_2018 <- investment_services_projects %>%
  filter(country == "Brazil",
         date_disclosed >= "2017-07-01",
         date_disclosed <= "2018-06-30") 

ggplot(brazil_investment_projects_2018, aes(x = date_disclosed, y = total_investment, color = status)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Investment Services Projects in Brazil in 2018",
    x = "Date Disclosed",
    y = "Total IFC Investment in Dollars in Millions"
  ) 
```
