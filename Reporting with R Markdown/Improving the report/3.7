<!--Exercise
Excluding warnings
Previously, you used the collapse option so that the code and resulting warning messages appear in the same block in the knit report. In this exercise, you'll use the warning option to prevent warnings from appearing in the final report.

Instructions
100 XP
Using the warning option, add to the code chunks that render a plot with a warning, so that the warning messages no longer appear in the knit file.-->

## Datasets 
### Investment Annual Summary
The `investment_annual_summary` dataset provides a summary of the dollars in millions provided to each region for each fiscal year, from 2012 to 2018.
```{r investment-annual-summary, out.width = '85%', fig.cap = 'Figure 1.1 The Investment Annual Summary for each region for 2012 to 2018.'}
ggplot(investment_annual_summary, aes(x = fiscal_year, y = dollars_in_millions, color = region)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Investment Annual Summary",
    x = "Fiscal Year",
    y = "Dollars in Millions"
  )
```

### Investment Projects in Brazil
The `investment_services_projects` dataset provides information about each investment project from 2012 to 2018. Information listed includes the project name, company name, sector, project status, and investment amounts. Projects that do not have an associated investment amount are excluded from the plot.

```{r brazil-investment-projects, out.width = '95%', fig.cap = 'Figure 1.2 The Investment Services Projects in Brazil from 2012 to 2018.', warning = FALSE}
brazil_investment_projects <- investment_services_projects %>%
  filter(country == "Brazil") 

ggplot(brazil_investment_projects, aes(x = date_disclosed, y = total_investment, color = status)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Investment Services Projects in Brazil",
    x = "Date Disclosed",
    y = "Total IFC Investment in Dollars in Millions"
  )
```

### Investment Projects in Brazil in 2018
The `investment_services_projects` dataset was filtered below to focus on information about each investment project from the 2018 fiscal year, and is referred to as `brazil_investment_projects_2018`. Projects that do not have an associated investment amount are excluded from the plot.

```{r brazil-investment-projects-2018, out.width = '95%', fig.cap = 'Figure 1.3 The Investment Services Projects in Brazil in 2018.', warning = FALSE}
brazil_investment_projects_2018 <- investment_services_projects %>%
  filter(country == "Brazil",
         date_disclosed >= "2017-07-01",
         date_disclosed <= "2018-06-30") 

ggplot(brazil_investment_projects_2018, aes(x = date_disclosed, y = total_investment, color = status)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Investment Services Projects in Brazil in 2018",
    x = "Date Disclosed",
    y = "Total IFC Investment in Dollars in Millions"
  ) 
```
