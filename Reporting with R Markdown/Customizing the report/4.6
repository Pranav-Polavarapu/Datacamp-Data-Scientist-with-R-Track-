<!--Exercise
Adding multiple parameters to the report
Previously, you added a parameter for country to create new reports to summarize information about the investment projects for any country included in the investment_services_projects data. Now, you'll add parameters for the fiscal year and modify the existing code so that you can create new reports about the investment projects for any country and fiscal year from the investment_services_projects data.

Instructions
100 XP
Add an fy parameter for the fiscal year and list 2018 as the fiscal year.
Add parameters for the year_start and year_end dates, using 2017-07-01 for the year_start and 2018-06-30 for the year_end of the 2018 fiscal year.
Replace date references in the filter() on lines 64 and 65 with references to the year_start and year_end parameters.
In the country-investment-projects-2018 code chunk, rename the code chunk to country-annual-investment-projects and object name and object name references in the text to country_annual_investment_projects.-->

## Datasets 

### Investment Annual Summary
The `investment_annual_summary` dataset provides a summary of the dollars in millions provided to each region for each fiscal year, from 2012 to 2018.
```{r investment-annual-summary}
ggplot(investment_annual_summary, aes(x = fiscal_year, y = dollars_in_millions, color = region)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Investment Annual Summary",
    x = "Fiscal Year",
    y = "Dollars in Millions"
  )
```

### Investment Projects in `r params$country`
The `investment_services_projects` dataset provides information about each investment project from 2012 to 2018. Information listed includes the project name, company name, sector, project status, and investment amounts. Projects that do not have an associated investment amount are excluded from the plot.

```{r country-investment-projects}
country_investment_projects <- investment_services_projects %>%
  filter(country == params$country) 

ggplot(country_investment_projects, aes(x = date_disclosed, y = total_investment, color = status)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Investment Services Projects",
    x = "Date Disclosed",
    y = "Total IFC Investment in Dollars in Millions"
  )
```

### Investment Projects in `r params$country` in 2018
The `investment_services_projects` dataset was filtered below to focus on information about each investment project from the 2018 fiscal year, and is referred to as `country_annual_investment_projects`. Projects that do not have an associated investment amount are excluded from the plot.
```{r country-annual-investment-projects}
country_annual_investment_projects <- investment_services_projects %>%
  filter(country == params$country,
         date_disclosed >= params$year_start,
         date_disclosed <= params$year_end) 

ggplot(country_annual_investment_projects, aes(x = date_disclosed, y = total_investment, color = status)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Investment Services Projects",
    x = "Date Disclosed",
    y = "Total IFC Investment in Dollars in Millions"
  ) 
```
