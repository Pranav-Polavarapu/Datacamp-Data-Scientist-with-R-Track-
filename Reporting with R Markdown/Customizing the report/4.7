<!--Exercise
Creating a new report using multiple parameters
Now that you've added parameters to account for the fiscal year, you'll create a new report for another country and fiscal year from the investment_services_projects data.

Instructions
100 XP
Replace "2018" in the header on line 59 and the text on line 60 with references to the fiscal year parameter.
Using the country parameter, create an Investment Report for Bangladesh.
Modify the year_start, year_end, and fy parameters so that the Investment Report you create focuses on data from the 2014 fiscal year.

## Datasets 

### Investment Annual Summary
The `investment_annual_summary` dataset provides a summary of the dollars in millions provided to each region for each fiscal year, from 2012 to 2018.
```{r investment-annual-summary}
ggplot(investment_annual_summary, aes(x = fiscal_year, y = dollars_in_millions, color = region)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Investment Annual Summary",
    x = "Fiscal Year",
    y = "Dollars in Millions"
  )
```

### Investment Projects in `r params$country`
The `investment_services_projects` dataset provides information about each investment project from 2012 to 2018. Information listed includes the project name, company name, sector, project status, and investment amounts. Projects that do not have an associated investment amount are excluded from the plot.

```{r country-investment-projects}
country_investment_projects <- investment_services_projects %>%
  filter(country == params$country) 

ggplot(country_investment_projects, aes(x = date_disclosed, y = total_investment, color = status)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Investment Services Projects",
    x = "Date Disclosed",
    y = "Total IFC Investment in Dollars in Millions"
  )
```

### Investment Projects in `r params$country` in `r params$fy`
The `investment_services_projects` dataset was filtered below to focus on information about each investment project from the `r params$fy` fiscal year, and is referred to as `country_annual_investment_projects`. Projects that do not have an associated investment amount are excluded from the plot.
```{r country-annual-investment-projects}
country_annual_investment_projects <- investment_services_projects %>%
  filter(country == params$country,
         date_disclosed >= params$year_start,
         date_disclosed <= params$year_end) 

ggplot(country_annual_investment_projects, aes(x = date_disclosed, y = total_investment, color = status)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Investment Services Projects",
    x = "Date Disclosed",
    y = "Total IFC Investment in Dollars in Millions"
  ) 
```
