Within the <style> and </style> boundaries, add body and curly braces to modify the document background and pre and curly braces to modify the code chunks.
Within the curly braces for body add #708090 for the text color using color, Calibri for the font-family, and #F5F5F5 for the background-color.
Within the curly braces for pre, specify #708090 for the color, and #F8F8FF for the background-color.-->

## Datasets 

### Investment Annual Summary
The `investment_annual_summary` dataset provides a summary of the dollars in millions provided to each region for each fiscal year, from 2012 to 2018.
```{r investment-annual-summary}
ggplot(investment_annual_summary, aes(x = fiscal_year, y = dollars_in_millions, color = region)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Investment Annual Summary",
    x = "Fiscal Year",
    y = "Dollars in Millions"
  )
```

### Investment Projects in `r params$country`
The `investment_services_projects` dataset provides information about each investment project from 2012 to 2018. Information listed includes the project name, company name, sector, project status, and investment amounts. Projects that do not have an associated investment amount are excluded from the plot.

```{r country-investment-projects}
country_investment_projects <- investment_services_projects %>%
  filter(country == params$country) 

ggplot(country_investment_projects, aes(x = date_disclosed, y = total_investment, color = status)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Investment Services Projects",
    x = "Date Disclosed",
    y = "Total IFC Investment in Dollars in Millions"
  )
```

### Investment Projects in `r params$country` in `r params$fy`
The `investment_services_projects` dataset was filtered below to focus on information about each investment project from the `r params$fy` fiscal year, and is referred to as `country_annual_investment_projects`. Projects that do not have an associated investment amount are excluded from the plot.
```{r country-annual-investment-projects}
country_annual_investment_projects <- investment_services_projects %>%
  filter(country == params$country,
         date_disclosed >= params$year_start,
         date_disclosed <= params$year_end) 

ggplot(country_annual_investment_projects, aes(x = date_disclosed, y = total_investment, color = status)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Investment Services Projects",
    x = "Date Disclosed",
    y = "Total IFC Investment in Dollars in Millions"
  ) 
```
