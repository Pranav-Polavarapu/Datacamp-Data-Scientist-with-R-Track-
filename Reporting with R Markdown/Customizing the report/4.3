<!--Exercise
Adding table of contents options
When toc_float is included, the table of contents appears on the left side of the document and remains visible while the reader scrolls through the document. By default, it displays the largest header, will expand as someone is reading through the report or interacting with the table of contents to navigate to another section, and animates page scrolls when navigating the report.

In this exercise, you'll add toc_float and modify these settings using the collapsed and smooth_scroll fields so that the full table of contents remains visible and page scrolls are not animated.

Instructions
100 XP
Below the toc field, add toc_float and a colon at the end of the field.
On a new line, add another indentation and the collapsed field, so that the full table of contents remains visible throughout the report.
Add another line and add the smooth_scroll field so that page scrolls are not animated.-->

## Datasets 

### Investment Annual Summary
The `investment_annual_summary` dataset provides a summary of the dollars in millions provided to each region for each fiscal year, from 2012 to 2018.
```{r investment-annual-summary}
ggplot(investment_annual_summary, aes(x = fiscal_year, y = dollars_in_millions, color = region)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Investment Annual Summary",
    x = "Fiscal Year",
    y = "Dollars in Millions"
  )
```

### Investment Projects in Brazil
The `investment_services_projects` dataset provides information about each investment project from 2012 to 2018. Information listed includes the project name, company name, sector, project status, and investment amounts. Projects that do not have an associated investment amount are excluded from the plot.

```{r brazil-investment-projects}
brazil_investment_projects <- investment_services_projects %>%
  filter(country == "Brazil") 

ggplot(brazil_investment_projects, aes(x = date_disclosed, y = total_investment, color = status)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Investment Services Projects in Brazil",
    x = "Date Disclosed",
    y = "Total IFC Investment in Dollars in Millions"
  )
```

### Investment Projects in Brazil in 2018
The `investment_services_projects` dataset was filtered below to focus on information about each investment project from the 2018 fiscal year, and is referred to as `brazil_investment_projects_2018`. Projects that do not have an associated investment amount are excluded from the plot.

```{r brazil-investment-projects-2018}
brazil_investment_projects_2018 <- investment_services_projects %>%
  filter(country == "Brazil",
         date_disclosed >= "2017-07-01",
         date_disclosed <= "2018-06-30") 

ggplot(brazil_investment_projects_2018, aes(x = date_disclosed, y = total_investment, color = status)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Investment Services Projects in Brazil in 2018",
    x = "Date Disclosed",
    y = "Total IFC Investment in Dollars in Millions"
  ) 
```
