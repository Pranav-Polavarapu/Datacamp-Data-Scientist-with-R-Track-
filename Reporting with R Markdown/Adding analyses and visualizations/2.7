<!--Exercise
Setting chunk options globally
Now that your plots are ready to include in your report, you can modify how they appear once the file is knit. Previously, you learned the difference between setting options globally and setting them locally. In this exercise, you'll set options for the figures globally, which means the options will apply to all figures throughout the code chunks in the report.

Instructions
100 XP
Add to the setup chunk at the top of the report to align all figures in the center of the report.
Add another option to the setup chunk so that the output width of all figures are 80%.-->

## Datasets 

### Investment Annual Summary

The `investment_annual_summary` dataset provides a summary of the dollars in millions provided to each region for each fiscal year, from 2012 to 2018.
```{r investment-annual-summary}
ggplot(investment_annual_summary, aes(x = fiscal_year, y = dollars_in_millions, color = region)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Investment Annual Summary",
    x = "Fiscal Year",
    y = "Dollars in Millions"
  )
```

### Investment Projects in Brazil

The `investment_services_projects` dataset provides information about each investment project from 2012 to 2018. Information listed includes the project name, company name, sector, project status, and investment amounts.
```{r brazil-investment-projects}
brazil_investment_projects <- investment_services_projects %>%
  filter(country == "Brazil") 

ggplot(brazil_investment_projects, aes(x = date_disclosed, y = total_investment, color = status)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Investment Services Projects in Brazil",
    x = "Date Disclosed",
    y = "Total IFC Investment in Dollars in Millions"
  )
```

### Investment Projects in Brazil in 2018

```{r brazil-investment-projects-2018}
brazil_investment_projects_2018 <- investment_services_projects %>%
  filter(country == "Brazil",
         date_disclosed >= "2017-07-01",
         date_disclosed <= "2018-06-30") 

ggplot(brazil_investment_projects_2018, aes(x = date_disclosed, y = total_investment, color = status)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Investment Services Projects in Brazil in 2018",
    x = "Date Disclosed",
    y = "Total IFC Investment in Dollars in Millions"
  ) 
```
