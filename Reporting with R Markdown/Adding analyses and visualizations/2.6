<!--Exercise
Visualizing all projects for one country and year
Now, you'll create a line plot using the data that was filtered for all projects that occurred in Brazil in the 2018 fiscal year. In the previous exercises, the labels were added for you. While creating this plot, you'll gain some experience adding your own labels that will appear when you knit the report.

In the brazil-investment-projects-2018 code chunk, create a scatterplot of the brazil_investment_projects_2018 data.
Add the title "Investment Services Projects in Brazil in 2018" to the plot.
Label the x-axis "Date Disclosed" and the y-axis "Total IFC Investment in Dollars in Millions".-->

## Datasets 

### Investment Annual Summary

The `investment_annual_summary` dataset provides a summary of the dollars in millions provided to each region for each fiscal year, from 2012 to 2018.
```{r investment-annual-summary}
ggplot(investment_annual_summary, aes(x = fiscal_year, y = dollars_in_millions, color = region)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Investment Annual Summary",
    x = "Fiscal Year",
    y = "Dollars in Millions"
  )
```

### Investment Projects in Brazil

The `investment_services_projects` dataset provides information about each investment project from 2012 to 2018. Information listed includes the project name, company name, sector, project status, and investment amounts.
```{r brazil-investment-projects}
brazil_investment_projects <- investment_services_projects %>%
  filter(country == "Brazil") 

ggplot(brazil_investment_projects, aes(x = date_disclosed, y = total_investment, color = status)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Investment Services Projects in Brazil",
    x = "Date Disclosed",
    y = "Total IFC Investment in Dollars in Millions"
  )
```

### Investment Projects in Brazil in 2018

```{r brazil-investment-projects-2018}
brazil_investment_projects_2018 <- investment_services_projects %>%
  filter(country == "Brazil",
         date_disclosed >= "2017-07-01",
         date_disclosed <= "2018-06-30") 

ggplot(brazil_investment_projects_2018, aes(x = date_disclosed, y = total_investment, color = status)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Investment Services Projects in Brazil in 2018",
    x =  "Date Disclosed",
    y = "Total IFC Investment in Dollars in Millions"
