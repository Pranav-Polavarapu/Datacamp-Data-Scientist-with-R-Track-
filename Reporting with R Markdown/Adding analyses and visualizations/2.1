<!-- Exercise 
Filtering for a specific country
Previously, you learned how to filter the data to find out more information about projects that occurred in Indonesia. Now, you'll build a report that provides this information for another country that's included in the investment_services_project data. In this exercise, you'll begin filtering the data to gather information about projects that occurred in Brazil.

Instructions
100 XP
Load the dplyr package in the first code chunk on line 10 right after the readr package on line 9.
In the third code chunk, filter the investment_services_projects data to determine which projects occurred in Brazil.
Save the result as brazil_investment_projects.
Label the code chunk brazil-investment-projects.-->

## Datasets 

### Investment Annual Summary

The `investment_annual_summary` dataset provides a summary of the dollars in millions provided to each region for each fiscal year, from 2012 to 2018.
```{r investment-annual-summary}
investment_annual_summary
```

### Investment Projects in Brazil

The `investment_services_projects` dataset provides information about each investment project from 2012 to 2018. Information listed includes the project name, company name, sector, project status, and investment amounts.
```{r brazil-investment-projects}
brazil_investment_projects<- investment_services_projects %>%
  filter(country=='Brazil')

brazil_investment_projects
```
