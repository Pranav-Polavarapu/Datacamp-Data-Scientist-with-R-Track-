## Datasets 

### Investment Annual Summary

The `investment_annual_summary` dataset provides a summary of the dollars in millions provided to each region for each fiscal year, from 2012 to 2018.
```{r investment-annual-summary, out.width = '85%', fig.cap = 'Figure 1.1 The Investment Annual Summary for each region for 2012 to 2018.'}
ggplot(investment_annual_summary, aes(x = fiscal_year, y = dollars_in_millions, color = region)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Investment Annual Summary",
    x = "Fiscal Year",
    y = "Dollars in Millions"
  )
```

### Investment Projects in Brazil

The `investment_services_projects` dataset provides information about each investment project from 2012 to 2018. Information listed includes the project name, company name, sector, project status, and investment amounts.
```{r brazil-investment-projects, out.width = '95%', fig.cap = 'Figure 1.2 The Investment Services Projects in Brazil from 2012 to 2018.'}
brazil_investment_projects <- investment_services_projects %>%
  filter(country == "Brazil") 

ggplot(brazil_investment_projects, aes(x = date_disclosed, y = total_investment, color = status)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Investment Services Projects in Brazil",
    x = "Date Disclosed",
    y = "Total IFC Investment in Dollars in Millions"
  )
```

### Investment Projects in Brazil in 2018

```{r brazil-investment-projects-2018, out.width = '95%', fig.cap = 'Figure 1.3 The Investment Services Projects in Brazil in 2018.'}
brazil_investment_projects_2018 <- investment_services_projects %>%
  filter(country == "Brazil",
         date_disclosed >= "2017-07-01",
         date_disclosed <= "2018-06-30") 

ggplot(brazil_investment_projects_2018, aes(x = date_disclosed, y = total_investment, color = status)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Investment Services Projects in Brazil in 2018",
    x = "Date Disclosed",
    y = "Total IFC Investment in Dollars in Millions"
  )
